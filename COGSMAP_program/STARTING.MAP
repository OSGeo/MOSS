                    of the Map Analysis Package

            DATE:   Spring 1986

                                                                             _____________________________________________________________________________



We  are  pleased  to  announce  that the Map Analysis Package (MAP), a digital
cartographic  modeling  system  originally  designed  for  academic  use  on a
mainframe  computer,  is  now  available  in a form that can be run on certain
International  Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) personal computers. MAP is
a  computer program that provides for the input, output, and transformation of
raster-formatted  cartographic  data.  This  is  done  by  way of algebra-like
operations controlled through English-like commands.

Initially  developed  as a student project at Harvard University (Tomlin 1975)
and  later  expanded as part of a doctoral dissertation at Yale (Tomlin 1983),
MAP  has  never  been  formally  distributed. Developmental versions have been
made  available to a number public and private organizations, however, and are
in  use at hundreds of locations around the world. This has resulted in a wide
variety   of  application  projects  and  an  interesting  array  of  software
enhancements  developed by independent users. It is our hope that this kind of
work  will  be  further  encouraged  by  the  ability to run MAP on a personal
computer.

The  Map Analysis Package can now be run on an IBM-PC (or equivalent) computer
equipped  with a monochrome or color display, a 360 kilobyte diskette drive, a
fixed  disk  or  second diskette drive, 256 kilobytes of random access memory,
an  8087  math  coprocessor,  and  version 2.1 (or greater) of the IBM-PC Disk
Operating  System.  The program is offered in both source and executable form.
Its  FORTRAN  source  code  is  essentially  the same as that of the mainframe
program  and,  with  the IBM-PC Professional FORTRAN Compiler, can be tailored
to  individual needs. The executable module cannot be modified but, on systems
with  at  least  360  kilobytes of random access memory, can be run as is with
maps  of  up to 32,640 points. With IBM Virtual Device Interface software, the
program can also be used to generate output on a variety of graphic devices.

The  Map  Analysis  Package is distributed as a set of DOS files on diskettes.
These files contain programs, sample data, and documentation as follows.

    STARTING.MAP      is  a  text  file  of general information that should be
                      read before installing the system.

    MAP-----.EXE      is  an  executable run file of the Map Analysis Package.
                      It  has  been  configured to handle maps of up to 32,640
                      points  and  will  run  successfully  on  any  IBM-PC or
                      equivalent  computer equipped with a monochrome or color
                      display,  a 360 kilobyte diskette drive, a fixed disk or
                      second  diskette drive, at least 360 kilobytes of random
                      access  memory, an 8087 math coprocessor, version 2.1 or
                      greater  of  the  IBM-PC Disk Operating System, and (for
                      certain  optional  graphic capabilities) the IBM Virtual
                      Device Interface software.

    MAP.BAT           is a DOS batch file that invokes MAP-----.EXE.

    M1.FOR,           are text files containing the FORTRAN source code from
    M2.FOR, ...       which  MAP-----.EXE  was  compiled.  These  files can be
                      modified   and  recompiled  with  the  IBM  Professional
                      FORTRAN  Compiler,  which  must  be acquired separately.
                      (Note  that  compiled object modules should be linked to
                      the PROFVDI library with stack size set to 5000.)

    ALTITUDE.-BP,     are binary files of sample data for what is termed the
    WATER.-BP, ...    Brown's Pond (BP) study area.

    BP.IN             is  a  text  file  of  Map Analysis Package instructions
                      that will be executed each time the BP map is opened.

    DEMO.IN           is  a  text  file  of  Map Analysis Package instructions
                      that  can  be  invoked  (by  way of a READ operation) to
                      provide   an   introductory   demonstration   of  system
                      capabilities  using  the  BP  sample  data. It should be
                      used  only  on  systems  equipped  with  a color display
                      driven  the  IBM  Virtual  Device  Interface  system.  A
                      second, monochrome display is also recommended.

    BASICS.EX         is  a text file containing the first sections of the Map
                      Analysis   Package  users'  manual.  This  file  can  be
                      accessed  from  within the package (by way of an EXPLAIN
                      operation) and/or printed out for general reference.

    ADD.EX,           are text files containing the final sections of the Map
    ASSIGN.EX, ...    Analysis   Package   users'  manual.  Each  describes  a
                      different  operation.  These  files can be accessed from
                      within  the  package  (by  way  of an EXPLAIN operation)
                      and/or printed out for general reference.

To  install these files, copy them to hard disk or a second pair of diskettes.
The package can then be executed by issuing the DOS batch command MAP.

The  Map Analysis Package stores data in DOS files corresponding to individual
map  overlays. Each has a DOS filename made up of an overlay title followed by
a  dot,  a  dash,  and a map name as in ALTITUDE.-BP. These files are coded in
binary form and organized as follows.

    Bytes 0001 through 1600    contain   100   sixteen-character   labels  for
                               regions 0 through 99, respectively.

    Byte  1601                 contains   a  one-character  protection  status
                               indicator   set   to  "P"  (protected)  or  "E"
                               (exposed).

    Bytes 1602 through 1664    are unused.

    Bytes 1665 through 1666    contain  a  two-byte integer indicating overlay
                               scale. Note that 1665 = (128 * 13) + 1.

    Bytes 1667 through 1792    are unused.

    Bytes 1793 through 1796    contain  a  four-byte  integer  indicating  the
                               number  of  rows  on  the  map  containing this
                               overlay.  Note  that  1793  = (128 * 14) + 1 or
                               (449 * 4) + 1.

    Bytes 1797 through 1800    contain  a  four-byte  integer  indicating  the
                               number  of  columns  on the map containing this
                               overlay. Note that 1797 = (450 * 4) + 1.

    Bytes 1801 through 1804    contain  a  four-byte  integer  indicating  the
                               standard  scale  of  the  map  containing  this
                               overlay. Note that 1801 = (451 * 4) + 1.

    Bytes 1805 through 1920    are unused.

    Bytes 1921 through N       (where  N  is  1920  plus  twice  the number of
                               points   on   the   overlay)  contain  two-byte
                               integer   values   for   overlay  points  in  a
                               sequence  moving  from left to right across the
                               top  row,  then the row below, and so on toward
                               the  lower  right corner. Note that 1921 = (128
                               * 15) + 1.

    Bytes N+1  through M        (where  M  is  the next even multiple of 1920)
                                are unused.
