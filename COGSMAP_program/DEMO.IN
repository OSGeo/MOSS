Welcome to the Map Analysis Package (MAP).
.
.
MAP is a set of programs that provide for the input, transformation, and output
of cartographic data.  Data are stored in the form of single-factor maps called
"overlays."   These are then treated as variables in an algebra of cartographic
operations.  Each operation is controlled by way of a English-like instruction.
.
The names that appeared when map "BP" was accessed were the titles of overlays
currently stored.  On the monitor now is an image that should give you an idea
of what they look like.  This is a bird's-eye view of streams, ponds, and wet-
lands on a topographic surface.  The surface is defined by an overlay entitled
ALTITUDE, while colors are defined by an overlay called WATER.

Each map overlay is stored as a two-dimensional array of numbers.  The position
of each number corresponds to a cartographic point location, while the value of
each number represents a geographic characteristic.  On the ALTITUDE overlay,
for example, each point's value indicates its height in feet above sea level,
whereas WATER values simply distinguish among the different water body types.
.
.
In a moment you will see a listing of the point-by-point values on the WATER
overlay, which is now being redrawn on the color monitor.  Note that this is
an overlay of 60 rows by 60 columns or 3600 points.  MAP works best on over-
lays of about ten times this size.

To illustrate how this type of information might be used, consider a typical
(if contrived) siting problem.	A new highway corridor must be located that:
	    1) avoids land near water bodies;
	    2) avoids steep topographic slopes;
	    3) extends from the center of the study area to
	       the centers of its upper and lower boundaries.
First, distance to water is measured by applying an operation called SPREAD
to the WATER overlay still shown on your color screen.	The instruction for
this operation, which is now being executed, is:
		     SPREAD WATER TO 3 FOR DISTANCE

SPREAD WATER TO 3

.
.
.
.
.
The results of the SPREAD operation are now being drawn on the color screen.
This is a new overlay, entitled DISTANCE, on which of distance zones around
all streams, ponds, and wetlands (in black) have been delineated.
.

Next, an instruction given as:
.     RECODE DISTANCE FOR WATER$ ASSIGNING 2 THROUGH 1 AND 1 THROUGH 3
.
calls for the tranformation of DISTANCE into an overlay entitled WATER$.  On
WATER$, a value of 2 is assigned to all points within one distance unit of a
water body, while 1 is assigned to points further away.  These indicate that
areas near water (shown in blue) will be more costly for highway development.

A similar overlay of road-building costs due to steep slopes will now
be created.  This is being done in response to instructions given as:
		  DIFFERENTIATE ALTITUDE FOR STEEPNESS
    RECODE STEEPNESS FOR SLOPE$ ASSIGNING 0 THROUGH 10 AND 1 THROUGH 99
.
These operations will transform the ALTITUDE overlay, now being drawn on
the color screen, into an overlay entitled SLOPE$.  A road-building cost
value of 0 will be assigned to slopes of up to 10%, while steeper slopes
are set to 1.

WATER$ and SLOPE$ can now be combined by adding their point-by-point values.
This has just been done in response to an instruction issued as:
.		      ADD WATER$ TO SLOPE$ FOR ROADCOST
.
to yield an overlay entitled ROADCOST with values as follows:
.
.		      1 (red)	= DRY AND FLAT
.		      2 (blue)	= WET AND FLAT or DRY AND STEEP
.		      3 (white) = WET AND STEEP

And to now to trace the highway that best avoids the blue and white regions.
The highway must connect the center of the study area to the centers of its
upper and lower edges.	Trace your own route while MAP does the same.  This
may take several minutes.
.
.
In selecting your own route, remember that each blue point is twice as costly
to develop as each red point, while each white point is three times as costly.
The object is to cross the study area while minimizing the sum of these costs.

MAP's path-finding procedure begins with another SPREAD operation measuring
distance from the center of the study area.  Here, however, distance is not
expressed in feet or meters but in units of accumulated road-building costs.
Note how concentric distance zones tend to bend around areas of higher cost.

Minimum-cost routes can now be generated as "steepest downhill" paths over
this accumulated-cost surface.	In this case, paths will begin at the mid-
points of the upper and lower edges of the study area then "drain" toward
its center.

what areas are visible from bridges (see color monitor) that will have
to be built for this new highway?  Here, the RADIATE operation is used.
