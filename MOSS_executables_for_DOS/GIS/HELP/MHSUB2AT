5. SUB2ATT    (SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE INPUT)

     This option allows the user to create a attribute input data file and
attribute definition file from the subjects in an existing vector map.  The
existing subjects may be composed of codes or values separated by some
delimiter, or be in column format with data dependent on its position.  If
using the delimiter option, the program starts writing the subject from the
first position and continues until it finds the delimiter. If the delimiter is
missing, the entire subject is written.  Once the delimiter is found, the
program saves the delimiter's position plus one as the starting position for
searching for the next field. The key point to remember is that the data is
written from the current starting position to the delimiter.

  After the SUB2AT option is performed, the ATTRIBUTE option (#3)
is used to add the multiple attributes to the map and create the multiple
attributes (.AT) file.  The following is an example of use of the SUB2AT option:
