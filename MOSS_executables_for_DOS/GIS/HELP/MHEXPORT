EXPORT                                                                   EXPORT



     The EXPORT command is summarized as follows:

          EXPORT is a data manipulation command which allows the user to create
          a text file in import/export format using an active map ID as input.
          This command would typically be used to export data into a different
          geoprocessing system or to pass data to another computer.

          The file generated by EXPORT is called "Export" and can be found in
          the user's work area.  These files can become rather large so the
          user should ensure there is sufficient space and should delete the
          file when it is no longer needed.  If it is desired to retain the
          file, it should be renamed as use of the command deletes any existing
          "Export" file.


     The EXPORT command is specified as follows:

          EXPORT (active ID)


     The individual parameters of the EXPORT command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a map referenced in the active map
          table which is to be exported.


     The following is an example of use of the EXPORT command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? EXPORT
           ENTER ACTIVE DATA SET I.D. TO EXPORT
          ? 1
           NUMBER OF DATA ITEMS TO BE EXPORTED =     5
           EXECUTING.  PLEASE WAIT . . .


     The limitations of the EXPORT command are as follows:

          -- Map must be active vector data.

          -- Any existing "Export" file is deleted.
