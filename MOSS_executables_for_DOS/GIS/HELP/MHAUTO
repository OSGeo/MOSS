     Autolabel is a labeling process for contour line maps.  Output may be in
the form of graphics or two new maps.  The OUT_NAME may be "SCREen" or any
seven character or less valid MOSS map name.  If "SCREen" is specified, then
output is directed to the graphic device.  If a valid MOSS map name is
specified, "OUTNAME" will be a TEXT map and "OUTNAME.MS" will be a masked
contour line map.

AUTO ID OUT_NAME  Subject_Interval Minimum_Subject Resolve_Level
                  Character_Height

     ID           is any currently active map

     OUT_NAME     is the output directive

     Subject_Interval allows the user to specify an interval to be applied to
                  the subjects of the input map.  Subject_Interval of 1
                  specifies all subjects to be labeled in the resultant map,
                  Sujbect_Interval of 3 every third subject to be labeled
                  with the default Subject_Interval of 5

     Minimum_Subject allows the user to specify the minimum subject value for
                  consideration of labeling and for applying the Subject_-
                  Interval factor

     Resolve_Level allows the user to specify the level of conflict resolving.
                  A Resolve_Level of 1 causes checking each label against the
                  current feature.  A Resolve_Level of 2 causes checking each
                  label against all other features as well as a Level 1 check.
                  A Resolve_Level of 3 causes checking each label against every
                  other label as well as both Level 1 and 2 checks.  The default
                  is no checking, 0

     Character_Height is the height and width of the labeled characters

     Limitations

     - Seven (7) character map names due to ".MS" extension

     - Window must be set

     - Works with existing contour maps with numeric subjects, I5 right
       justified

     - Active data set must exist
