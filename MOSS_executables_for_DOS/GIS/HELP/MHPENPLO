PENPLOT                                                               PENPLOT



     The PENPLOT command is summarized as follows:

          PENPLOT is a data display command which creates a file of active
          vector maps for output to a ZETA plotter.  Several options allow the
          user to: a) select output scale, b) display a bar scale (miles or
          kilometers), c) select pen colors for different maps, d) label
          points, lines, and polygons with subject or multiple attribute 
          labels, e) shade polygons (define color, angle, density), f) define 
          theme name for each map, g) define line or symbol type and color, h)
          rotate the plot at a user-specified angle or a calculated amount to
          correct for lat/long declination, i) generate a legend and optionally
          omit legend items, j) add a border, k) add a title, l) display map-
          names and selection criteria in the legend, m) add supplementary anno-
          tion, n) command the plotter to return to its original start location
          (return to origin feature), o) and optionally plot corner tic marks.

     The PENPLOT command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          PENPLOT (active ID's) (options)*

     The individual parameters of the PENPLOT command are described below:

          (active ID's) is the ID number(s) of a map(s) referenced in the
          active map table which is to be plotted.

          (options) are user-specified parameters defining the output plot.
          The command is an interactive command and all the necessary
          information is prompted.  The prompts and information pertinent
          to them are described in the following paragraphs.

          ENTER PLOT name:
             The name entered here is used to build the name of the file
             which will contain the plotting information.  The name entered
             will be prefixed by 'Z.' and placed in the :ZETA directory.

             For example:

              ENTER PLOT name:
              ______________________________
              WLFCOVER

             The file, Z.WLFCOVER, is created. This file will be gen-
             rated in the directory, :ZETA.  If the filename already exists,
             a message to that effect will be displayed and a menu des-
             cribing the available options will appear.

          Enter your name:
             The information input is used to identify the owner of the
             file.  This name is the first item written to the plot file.

             For example:

             Enter your name
             ____________________
             JANE

          Do you want DEFAULT plot parameters [CR=YES]?
             The DEFAULT plot parameters concern the archive date, the pen
             type, color positions and number of copies.  This information
             is written to the plot file as a header and is displayed on
             the operator's console before plotting begins. In this way,
             instructions concerning plotting the file  can be passed to
             the operator.The default for pen type is BALL. Pen number
             1 is black, pen 2 is red, pen 3 is blue and pen 4 is green.

             1 is black, pen 2 is red, pen 3 is blue and pen 4 is green.
             The plot repetition number is 1.  The default for the archive
             date is 90 days from the date the file is generated.  If the
             defaults are acceptable, answer YES to the prompt.  To change
             the defaults, enter NO. The following prompts, delineated
             by ***, will be provided.
      ***

          When can the plot be archived?
          MM DD YY
          __ __ __
             Enter a date which represents when it will no longer be
             necessary to keep the plot file on disk.

          Enter a Pen type.wet ink OR ball point.
             Enter WET if liquid ink is desired or BALL if ball point
             may be used. If WET is chosen, answer the following questions:
       **

          Enter a PEN POINT SIZE for EACH pen #
          The size of pens available are:
          00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
          pen # n .
          __
             Enter the size pen point to be loaded in pen position n.
             The 'pen # n' prompt will be repeated for n=1 to 4.
       **

          STANDARD pen #S AND COLORS?
          [POSITION 1=BLACK, 2=RED, 3=BLUE, 4=GREEN]
             Answer YES or NO to this question. Yes indicates that these
             color positions are acceptable. A response of no generates
             the following prompts:

        *
          Use pen # n?
             YES causes this prompt:
          ENTER pen color
             Type in a color, 6 characters maximum.  These two prompts will
             repeat four times.
        *

          ENTER number of copies.
             Put in the number of copies required.
      ***


          What scale do you want the map to be plotted? [CR=24000]?
             The default display scale is 1:24000. The user may default
             to this scale by entering a return.  Entering any number
             will change the denominator to this value.

             For example:

             What scale do you want the map to be plotted? [CR=24000]
             :64500

             The scale would be changed to 1:64500.  The system will
             then calculate the output map size in inches and display
             this data to the user.  It is optional to accept this scale
             or to enter a new one.  The maximum size map which can be
             plotted is 27" in the Y-direction with border and 33" without
             one.  If the selected scale defines a map larger than these
             limits, a warning is given.
 
          Default rotation for lat/long north alignment = x.xxx degrees,
          Enter 0 if you do not want the plot to be rotated,
          Enter CR for the default rotation.

          Enter the angle to rotate the plot in degrees: 0
            If you respond with an angle, the map will be rotated that amount.
            If you press CR, the map will be rotated the necessary amount to 
            align the map with the x-axis.
            If you enter 0, then no rotation will occur.

          A map border uses 6 inches of Y direction
                    with    MAP BORDER YMAX=27 inches
                    without MAP BORDER YMAX=33 inches
          Without border you cannot have bar scale or legend
          Do you want a border ? [CR=YES]
          Do you want a TITLE on the plot ? [CR=YES]
            If the answer is yes (Y), the contents of the file called 
            CALCOMP.TITLE is centered near the bottom of the plot.  The font
            and size can be specified within CALCOMP.TITLE.  This file is a
            simple text file which can be edited by the user or system manager
            using a text editor.

          Do you want TIC marks shown on the plot ? [CR=NO]
            If the answer is yes, the corners of the window will be shown along
            with x,y coordinate values.

          Do you want mapnames(s) and selection criteria displayed in the
          legend ? [CR=NO]
            I
          Do you want a bar scale on this plot ? [CR=YES]
             If the reponse to this is YES, a bar scale showing the
             scale will be plotted.

          A banner will then be displayed:

             Map #    n=mapname   (data type) data
             Selection Criteria = 

          This is a banner showing the active ID number (n), the file
          name (map name) and the data type (POINT, LINE or POLYGON).
          Following it is a series of questions which will allow the user
          to define how the map is to be plotted.  This process will be
          repeated for each active ID specified.

             For example:

             Map #    1=DISTURBAN     POLYGON data
             Selection Criteria = ALL

          Do you want multiple attribute labeling ? [CR=NO] Y
            This question is asked ONLY if this particular map has associated
            multiple attributes. If you answer yes (Y), you will be able to
            'stack' selected multiple attributes as labels on the plot.  Note:
            This prompt will be repeated each time for each active ID that has
            multiple attributes associated with the map.

          Enter the attributes in the order you want them plotted (BOT to TOP)
            This is where you specify what goes into the 'stack'.

          For Label    1

            1  =  Exit
            2  =  Retrieve by ID number
            3  =  Retrieve by KEY
            4  =  Retrieve SUBJECT
          : 2
            This menu gives you two methods to retrieve multiple attribute
            data.  You may also choose option 4 to place the subject label
            anywhere on the 'stack'.
          
          Enter the attribute ID : 4
            In this example, attribute ID number 4 was selected.  If option 3
            above is selected, the user is prompted for the attribute key.  This
            is a pre-defined name given to the data upon creation.  If the user
            chooses option 4, no additional prompt is given.  When the plot is 
            generated, the data pertaining to the current item is retrieved and
            then plotted on the 'stack' in the order entered.  The above menu
            is repeated until the user either enters 1 for exit, or the maximum
            of 10 labels is reached.

          Do you want to skip blank labels ? [CR=YES]
            Skipping blank labels means the 'stack' will be compressed if a
            blank data field is encountered.

          [Low,High] char positions of label to plot [CR=none, -1=item#] : 5,10
             The option is given to select which characters of the
             subject are to be plotted. Low represents the position of
             the first character to be plotted, High the last.  If a
             CR is entered, no labels are plotted. A -1 will cause
             the features to be labeled with the item number.

          Enter label HEIGHT and FONT # to use [CR=.07, #12] :
             This permits the user to designate the size and style
             characters to use in labeling. Charts showing the available
             fonts can be found in Appendix  .
 
          Enter degree of slant for labels [CR=0,RANGE=-90 to 90] : -23
             A negative value entered here will slant the font to the
             right.  A positive value will slant the font to the left.
             A CR or a value of 0 will cause no slanting to occur.

          Enter alignment code for labels - NW,NE,SW,SE [CR=NE] 
             This option is most helpful when plotting point data.  It 
             allows the user to change the default location of the
             first label.  The diagram below shows the optional loc-
             ations for the label:
                                    
                                    | 
                                NW  |  NE
                              ------x------
                                SW  |  SE
                                    |
             where x = symbol location for point data or
                       polygon 'centroid'.

          Enter pen position to plot the labels [0,1,2,...8] 1
             Enter the number which corresponds to the pen position
             which is holding the color desired for labels for this 
             map. A value of 0 indicates that labels are not to be
             drawn.  
             Note: Some ZETA plotters have only 4 pens, others 8 pens.
             If you plan to send a plotfile to a 4-pen ZETA, only use
             pens 1-4.

          If the map being plotted contains POLYGON data, the following
          sequence of questions will be asked.

          Do you want POLYGONS shaded [CR=YES]?
             If shading is desired, enter yes or return in response to
             this command. This will cause the following prompts to
             appear.

          Enter pen position to plot the SHADING  [0,1,2,...8]
             Enter the number which corresponds to the pen position
             which is holding the color desired for this map.  A value
             of 0 indicates that this data is not to be drawn.
             Note: Some ZETA plotters have only 4 pens, others 8 pens.
             If you plan to send a plotfile to a 4-pen ZETA, only use
             pens 1-4.

          Enter SHADE angle (0-360 degrees) [-ANGLE=crosshatch] 
             Input the angle in degrees for the shading lines to be
             plotted. (0=horizontal, 90=vertical...) A negative value
             will cause the polygon to be shaded with crosshatching.

          Enter DISTANCE between SHADE lines (inches) [CR=.1] :
             This value indicates the distance on the map between the
             shade lines. The default is .1 inch. This will be used if
             a CR is entered.

          Enter LINE TYPE for SHADE lines [CR=5=solid] :
             Enter the value which represents the line type which
             is desired for the shading. A CR will provide solid
             lines.

          If the data type is LINE, this series of prompts will appear.


          Assign LINE type ? [CR=YES]
             A YES response to this allows the user to define the style
             of the line used to draw this map. An answer of NO will
             give a default line type of 5 ( a solid line). The positive
             answer generates the following series of prompts.

          BLM LINE code [0=invisible, -1=contour] =
             Enter the value which corresponds to the desired line type.
             A table of the available line types is in Appendix  .

          Enter LINE WIDTH, DIST between MARKERS (inches) [CR=.1, .5] = ?
             LINE WIDTH sets the thickness of the lines and Dist between
             MARKERS is used to define the spacing between tics, crosses
             or other similar characters as applicable which are plotted
             as part of the line type.


          The following series of prompts will be displayed if the data
          type is POINT.


          Do you wish to assign SYMBOL type ? [CR=YES]
             To use a special symbol type, enter Yes or <return>. A
             negative response will cause the data to be plotted using
             the default symbol, X. Otherwise, the following prompts will
             be displayed.

          Enter SYMBOL code [0 or 99 = none] :
             Enter the value which corresponds to the desired symbol type.
             A table of the available symbols is in Appendix  .

          Enter SYMBOL height, width, angle :
             Input the desired height and width of the symbol and the
             angle in decimal degrees by which to rotate it.

          Do you want a pen stop ? [CR=NO]
             If the response is a NO or a CR, the plotter will not stop
             and the map will be drawn using the color in the pen
             position indicated.  If a YES response is entered, the
             notes entered as shown below will be displayed and the
             plotter will stop. The pen(s) can be changed at this time.

          When a pen stop is to be made, the following prompts appear.
             The responses are recorded in the plot file and are
             displayed on the console when the plotter stops. These
             notes are useful to remind the operator of the desired
             action.

          Enter holder number to change :
             Enter a 1,2,3 or 4 or some code which will indicate which
             pen(s) to change. This is printed on the console when the
             plotter stops.

          Enter color (maximum of 8 characters) :
             Enter a color or some 8 character note to indicate what color
             pens to place in the pen holders.  This note will be dis-
             played on the console when the plotter stops.

          Enter thickness :
             Enter some code to indicate what thickness of pen tip should
             be placed in the pen holder.  This note will be displayed
             on the console when the plotter stops.


          The last information required is a descrition of the map to be
          drawn in the map legend.


          Enter LEGEND description [CR=OMIT FROM LEGEND] :
             Input a textual description of this map data. It will be
             plotted along with a sample of the shading, line type or
             symbol, as applicable, in a legend to the lower right
             of the plot.  You may choose to omit this legend line 
             entirely by pressing CR.

          ANNOTATE file name [CR=none  ;ORIGIN=return to origin] =
             If an annotation file has been prepared using the ANNOTATE
             command, enter the filename. The filename must be something
             other than ORIGIN.  If the ORIGIN option is selected, the
             the plotter will set its origin to the original location
             where plotting began.  This is useful if the user wishes
             to plot several plotfiles one on top another.

     The following is an example of use of the PENPLOT command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? PENPLOT
           ENTER ACTIVE DATA SET I.D.'S TO PLOT
          ? 1


     The limitations of the PENPLOT command are as follows:

          -- Map must be active and window must be set.

          -- Maximum of 23 active IDs plotted at one time.

          -- Maximum of 10 labels per multiple attribute stack.
