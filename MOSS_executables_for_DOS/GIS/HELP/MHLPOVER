LPOVER                                                                   LPOVER



     The LPOVER command is summarized as follows:

          LPOVER is an overlay analysis command that creates a new map by
          determining the logical intersection between an active
          polygon map and an active point or line map. If the point or line
          map has multiple attributes, an entry will be made in the active
          map table.  Otherwise, a new map will be created in the work
          file.


     The LPOVER command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          LPOVER (ID1) (ID2) (new map name)* (subject merge)*


     The individual parameters of the LPOVER command are described below:

          (ID1) is the ID number of a polygon map referenced in the active map
          table which is the object of LPOVER.

          (ID2) is the ID number of an active line or point map referenced in
          the active map table.

          (new map name) is the name for the map resulting from LPOVER.  This
          parameter is not prompted for if the active ID2 has mutiple attributes.

          (subject merge) is an option which allows the user to specify how
          subjects should be merged between the two maps.  The user must res-
          pond YES, NO, or REV.  The YES option allows the user to specify the
          number of characters from each map to be contained in the new subject
          up to a maximum of 30 total.  The NO option defaults to 14 characters
          from the first map and 16 characters from the second.  This option
          may also be specified with <CR>.  The REV option will reverse the
          order of the default subject merge.  This parameter is not
          prompted for if active ID2 has multiple attributes.



     The following is an example of use of the LPOVER command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? LPOVER
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP I.D.'S TO LPOVER
          ? 1 2
           WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CALL THE NEW MAP
            __________
          ? MIGCONC
           Do you want to specify SUBJECT MERGE parameters [CR=NO]
              [NO = 14 chars from 1st and 16 chars from 2nd]
              [YES= input # chars from each subject]
              [REV= reverse order of subjects      ]        ? NO
           BUILD MOSS MAP DATA TYPE    2
           INTERSECTED FEATURES =     1


     The limitations of the LPOVER command are as follows:

          -- Both maps must be active and window must be set.

          -- Line or point maps must be the second ID specified in the command.

          -- Maximum of 30 characters for subject names.
