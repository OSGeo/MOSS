PERIMETER                                                             PERIMETER



     The PERIMETER command is summarized as follows:

          PERIMETER is a data description command that produces a summary table
          of length, frequency, and percent of the perimeter for each subject
          associated with any polygon map referenced in the active map table.
          More than one map may be described at one time.  Length is summarized
          in miles.


     The PERIMETER command is specified as follows:

          PERIMETER (active ID's) (HARDCOPY) (non-sort option)


     The individual parameters of the PERIMETER command are described below:

          (active ID's) are the ID numbers of polygon maps referenced in the
          active map table which are to be described.  If more than one map ID
          is entered the command will produce a table describing all of the
          maps specified.

          (HARDCOPY) is an option to obtain a hardcopy listing of the PERIMETER
          table on a line printer.  If HARDCOPY is specified output is written
          to a disk file called LINE.PRINTER.  This file can be printed by
          exiting MOSS and issuing the operating system print command.  If
          anything other than the characters HARDCOPY are specified in this
          option, the characters are used to specify a file name and the output
          is written to the file.  If the file exists, the output is appended to
          the existing file.  The name the operating system uses for the line
          printer can also be specified.  This parameter can only be entered in
          un-prompted mode (see example below).


          (non-sort option) is an option that allows the user to display a
          perimeter table for one or more active maps with subjects listed in
          the order digitized.  If the perimeter for more than one map is re-
          quested the subjects are grouped in the order that the ID's are typed.
          This option is activated by typing an "N" after the ID numbers or
          HARDCOPY.  A default would sort the subjects alphanumerically.


     The following is an example of use of the PERIMETER command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? PERIMETER
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP I.D.(S)
          ? 1

          To obtain a hardcopy listing:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? PERIMETER 1 HARDCOPY

          To obtain a non-sorted hardcopy:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? PERIMETER 1 2 HARDCOPY N


     The limitations of the PERIMETER command are as follows:

          -- Input map must be an active polygon map.

          -- No more than 2500 total unique subjects may be in the resultant
             perimeter table.

          -- No more than 40 active ID's may be described at one time.

          -- Items in table are not limited to those in display window.

          -- If the LINE.PRINTER file created by the HARDCOPY option is to
             be saved it should be renamed since use of the HARDCOPY option
             deletes existing LINE.PRINTER files.
