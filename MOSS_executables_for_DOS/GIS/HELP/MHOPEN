OPEN                                                                       OPEN



     The OPEN command is summarized as follows:

          OPEN is a program control command that permits the user to access
          master projects. If a master project is not opened, unpredictable
          results can occur.


     The OPEN command is specified as follows:

          OPEN (name)


     The individual parameters of the OPEN command are described below:

          (name) is the name of the file containing the master project map
          names.  This name provides access to the disk file containing the
          master project maps whose directory location was specified at the
          time MOSS was accessed (see Appendix A). The .DT extension is
          no longer required.


     The following is an example of use of the OPEN command

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? OPEN WOLF


     The limitations of the OPEN command are as follows:

          -- Name of the master database must be less than 10 characters.

          -- A master project must be open in order to access MAPS through
             MOSS (see also MAPS command).

          -- Only one master project may be accessed at a time.

          -- POLYGON should only be opened in MOSS if a file is to be
             added to the work directory using the ADD command. MAPS
             may not be entered with it open.
