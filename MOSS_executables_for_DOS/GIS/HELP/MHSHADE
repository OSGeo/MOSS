SHADE                                                                     SHADE



     The SHADE command is summarized as follows:

          SHADE is a data display command that allows the user to plot active
          polygon or cell maps on the CRT screen and shade the maps with dif-
          ferential cross-hatching.  If more than one active map ID number is
          entered following the SHADE command (see command format, below) each
          map will be plotted with different degrees of cross-hatching.  This
          allows the user to differentiate between map data sets.

          With polygon data, it is possible to use the ASSIGN command to physi-
          cally set hatch patterns in the database by subject.  If this proced-
          ure has been performed the SHADE command will ignore the default
          shade patterns and use the database assignments.


     The SHADE command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          SHADE (active ID's) (display range)* (cancel)*


     The individual parameters of the SHADE command are described below:

          (active ID's) is the ID number(s) of one or more polygon or cell maps
          referenced in the active map table which are to be shaded.

          (display range) is an option for cell data. If the active ID is a 
          discrete map, a prompt displaying the number of levels will appear.
          This is the same as the number of subjects. If the map is continuous,
          the minimum and maximum values are displayed. Then the user is asked
          to enter the display range. Two values must be entered, a lower
          boundary and an upper boundary. All cells which contain a value which
          is greater than or equal to the lower value and less than or equal to
          the upper value will be shaded.

          (cancel) is an option that allows the user to stop a plot of active
          maps without stopping MOSS.  Entering CAN or ABO while shading causes
          the main prompt to again appear.  This option is unprompted.


     The following are examples of use of the SHADE command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? SHADE
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP I.D.(S) TO SHADE
          ? 1
           ENTER COMMAND
          ? SHADE 2 2 2        (active ID 2 is a discrete map)
           THERE ARE   6 LEVELS. ENTER RANGE TO DISPLAY
          ? 1 1
           THERE ARE   6 LEVELS. ENTER RANGE TO DISPLAY
          ? 2 4
           THERE ARE   6 LEVELS. ENTER RANGE TO DISPLAY
          ? 5 6
           ENTER COMMAND
          ? SHADE 3            (active ID 3 is a continuous map)
           MINIMUM    6184.0000 MAXIMUM    7200.000 ENTER RANGE TO DISPLAY
          ? 6400 6800


     The limitations of the SHADE command are as follows:

          -- Display window must be set.

          -- For visual effectiveness, no more than 10 shade patterns should
             be displayed.

          -- If working with color display, a color display terminal is re-
             quired.
