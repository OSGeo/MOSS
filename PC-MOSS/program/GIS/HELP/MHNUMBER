NUMBER                                                                   NUMBER



     The NUMBER command is summarized as follows:

          Number is a data display command that allows the user to either plot
          active ID numbers at the label locations of items in a map, plot item
          ID number at the centroid, or plot polygon areas at the centroid.
          Area is expressed in acres.  A typical use might be to assign number
          1 to polygons of mule deer winter concentration range and number 2 to
          polygons of deer summer range.


     The NUMBER command is specified as follows:

          NUMBER (active ID's) (type of numbering)


     The individual parameters of the NUMBER command are described below:

          (active ID's) is the ID number(s) of an active map(s) referenced in
          the active map table which is to be numbered.

          (type of numbering) is an option for the user to specify what will be
          assigned.  The user must enter M(map ID), I(item number), or A(area).
          Map ID will assign active ID numbers to items on different maps.
          Item number will plot the ID number of all items on a given map at
          the label location of the item.  Area will plot area in acres at the
          label loction of all polygons in a given map.  If a line map is used,
          area will plot length at the median coordinate pair of each feature.


     The following is an example of use of the NUMBER command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? NUMBER
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP ID'S TO NUMBER
          ? 1
           Enter: [M]apid, [I]tems, or [A]reas ? I


     The limitations of the NUMBER command are as follows:

          -- Map must be active and window must be set.

          -- Does not work with cell data.

          -- Area is only given in acres.

          -- Only 40 maps may be numbered at a time.
