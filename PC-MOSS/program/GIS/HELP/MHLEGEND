LEGEND                                                                   LEGEND



     The LEGEND command is summarized as follows: 

          LEGEND is a data display command that allows the user to either
          display attribute information at the centroid of a feature or display
          the map name and the display scale.  Attribute information may be
          either the primary attribute or from the multiple attributes file.
          If a multiple attribute file exists, the user will be prompted with
          by a menu of retrieval options.

     The LEGEND command is specified as follows:

          LEGEND (active ID's) (display type) (number of characters)


     The individual parameters of the LEGEND command are described below:

          (active ID's) are the ID numbers of maps referenced in the active
          table.

          (display type) is an option to specify the type of display desired.
          The user may enter DESCRIBE, LABEL, CONTOUR or ELEVATION.  DESCRIBE
          produces a map legend with the map scale and map name.  The user will
          also be asked for crosshair input from the CRT cursor to position the
          legend. LABEL displays the subject (or multiple attribute informa-
          tion) for each item on the CRT beginning at the centroid of the line
          or polygon and moving horizontally.  ELEVATION works only with 3-D
          vector data sets (map types 1,12,13) and will display elevation of
          each point in a feature.  CONTOUR places a subject along a line and
          only works with line maps (map type 2). A more sophisticated method
          of placing numeric contour values in a contour map is available with
          the AUTOLABEL command.
 
          (number of characters) is the number of characters the user wishes
          to display from the label.  This parameter can only be entered in an
          un-prompted mode and must be less than thirty and greater than zero.
          This works with both character and numeric data.


     The following are examples of uses of the LEGEND command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? LEGEND
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP ID's TO LEGEND
          ? 1
           LABEL, ELEVATION, DESCRIBE, OR CONTOUR?
          ? DESCRIBE

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? LEGEND 1 LA 10

            1 = Exit
            2 = Retrieve by ID
            3 = Retrieve by KEY
            4 = Retrieve SUBJECT

            2
            Enter Attribute ID: 1

     NOTE: The above menu will occur if the map has a multiple attribute file.
 
     The limitations of the LEGEND command are as follows:

          -- Map must be active and window must be set.

          -- Does not work with cell data.
