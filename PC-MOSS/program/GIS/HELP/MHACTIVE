ACTIVE                                                                   ACTIVE



     The ACTIVE command is summarized as follows:

          ACTIVE is a data description command that produces a table
          referencing map data which have been "activated".  The command may
          be used frequently throughout a session to monitor maps that have
          been activated from master or workfiles.  Only maps referenced in
          the active table can be analyzed or displayed.  Commands which acti-
          vate data are: SELECT, BSEARCH, CONTIGUITY, LPOVER, SAMPLE, and SIZE.
          PROXIMITY will create an active ID when using a map with a multiple
          attribute file.

          The table produced by ACTIVE references each map with an ID number
          in the left-hand column.  This number is a parameter that is used to
          identify particular maps for analysis and display.  Number of items
          (i.e., features), map name, map type, and selection criteria are
          displayed for each active map.


     The ACTIVE command is specified as follows:

          ACTIVE


     There are no parameters associated with the ACTIVE command.


     The following is an example of use of the ACTIVE command:
