AUDIT                                                                     AUDIT



     The AUDIT command is summarized as follows:

          AUDIT is a data description command that displays a table showing for
          each feature in a map the subject, item number, perimeter in miles,
          area in acres, number of islands, and number of coordinate pairs.


     The AUDIT command is specified as follows:

          AUDIT (map name) (HARDCOPY)


     The individual parameters of the AUDIT command are described below:

          (map name) is the name of the map that the user wishes to examine.

          (HARDCOPY) is an option to obtain a hardcopy listing of the AUDIT
          table on a line printer.  Output is written to a disk file called
          LINE.PRINTER.  This file can be printed by exiting MOSS and issuing
          the operating system print command.  This parameter can only be en-
          tered in an unprompted mode (see example below).


     The following are examples of use of the AUDIT command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? AUDIT
           ENTER THE NAME OF THE MAP YOU WISH TO EXAMINE
          ? MDRWOLFRG

          To obtain a hardcopy listing:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? AUDIT MDRWOLFRG HARDCOPY


     The limitations of the AUDIT command are as follows:

          -- Can only use vector maps.

          -- If area or perimeter are greater than 9999999.99 then asterisks
             will be printed.

          -- If the LINE.PRINTER file created by the HARDCOPY option is to
             be saved it should be renamed since use of the HARDCOPY option
             deletes existing LINE.PRINTER files.
