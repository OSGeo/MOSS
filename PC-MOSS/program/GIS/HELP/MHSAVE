SAVE                                                                       SAVE



     The SAVE command is summarized as follows:

          SAVE is a data manipulation command which is used to save any point,
          line, or polygon map referenced in the active map table as part of the
          polygon workfile.  Once a map has been saved it can be accessed in
          subsequent sessions which eliminates the time and expense of having
          to recreate maps that will be used repetitively over a period of
          time.  If the original map has multiple attributes, those attributes
          pertaining to the active items will be saved as well.

     The SAVE command is specified as follows:

          SAVE (active ID) (new map name)


     The individual parameters of the SAVE command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a map referenced in the active map
          table which is to be saved.

          (new map name) is the new name of the map which is being saved.


     The following is an example of use of the SAVE command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? SAVE
           ENTER ACTIVE DATA SET I.D. TO SAVE
          ? 1
           WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CALL THE NEW MAP
            ________
          ? NEWWOLFRG
           NUMBER OF DATA ITEMS TO BE SAVED     37


     The limitations of the SAVE command are as follows:

          -- Only one active map can be saved at a time.

          -- Cannot save cell data.

          -- Maximum number of attributes saved is 4000.
