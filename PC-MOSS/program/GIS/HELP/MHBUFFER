BUFFER                                                                   BUFER



     The BUFFER command is summarized as follows:  

          BUFFER is a distance analysis command that generates a buffer (i.e.,
          a zone of influence) of user-specified distance around any map data
          referenced in the active map table.  BUFFER will draw zones of in-
          fluence around points (e.g., a ferret sighting), lines (e.g.,a road),
          or polygons (e.g., a city).  Result of the command is a polygon map
          that is saved as part of the workfile.  Since the buffer generation
          process may create overlapping polygons, the user of BUFFER may need
          to use the RESOLVE command to resolve these overlaps.


     The BUFFER command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

     BUFFER (active ID) (new map name) (radius) (buffer type)


     The individual parameters of the BUFFER command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a point, line, or polygon map 
          referenced in the active map table.

          (new map name) is the name for the map resulting from BUFFER.

          (radius) is the desired width or radius of the buffer zone in miles.


     The following is an example of use of the BUFFER command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? BUFFER
           PLEASE ENTER ACTIVE MAP ID.S TO BUFFER
          ? 1
           WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CALL THE NEW MAP
            __________
          ? SWSBUFFER
           PLEASE ENTER BUFFER ZONE IN MILES
          ? .025

	   ... Building BUFFER zones ....
          PROCESSING FEATURE     1
          BUILD MOSS MAP       DATA TYPE =   3

          TOTAL TIME     =       1.86
          TOTAL RECORDS  =     144.00
          TOTAL JOB COST =$       .02

           ENTER COMMAND

     The limitations of the BUFFER command are as follows:

          -- Buffer may produce erroneous results on "dirty" data; i.e.; lines
             with duplicate points or selfcrossing loops.

          -- Input map must be an active vector map with window set.

          -- Input map must have less than 750 points per feature or less than
             250 points per feature when resolving overlaps.

          -- May not function well with a large radius (e.g., > 1 mile).
