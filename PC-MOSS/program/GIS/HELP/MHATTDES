4. ATTDESCRIBE   (BUILD MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE DEFINITION FILE)

     This option allows the user to build a multiple attribute defintion (.DEF)
file.  This file may then be used with the ATTRIBUTE option (#3) to create the
the dictionary part of the .AT file and to add up to 200 multiple attributes to
a MOSS map, thus creating the data base part of the .AT file.  Prior to use
of this option the user must prepare a data input (.DAT) file.  This file must
be in a fixed field format with rows of items and columns of attributes.
Integers must be right-justified and alphanumeric strings must be left-
justified.  Note that the order of items in the data file must correspond to
the same order of occurrence of the items in the MOSS map. Use the MOSS AUDIT
command to see the existing item order.  For all ADD options that use a data
input file, the data input file MUST have the same number of ROWS of data as
there are ITEMS in the map. WARNING--- the file cannot contain TABS, if it
does, the program will CRASH. The file name cannot be longer than 19
characters.

For example, suppose a MOSS map has FIVE ITEMS, and three multiple attributes
are to be assigned to each item.  The data input file (called "TEST.DAT" in
this example) must have FIVE ROWS and might look as follows:

20 0.9 1.6
17 0.8 1.7
22 0.9 1.5
20 0.8 1.7
12 0.6 2.0


Once the input data file is created, the ATTDESCRIBE option may be used to
create a definition file which associates the map data with particular
attribute descriptors and set of values from the data file.  The following is
an example of use of ATTDESCRIBE:

NAME OF ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION FILE IS TEST.DEF

DO YOU WISH TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE "ADD" ATTRIBUTE PROGRAM
 (Y OR N):  Y

     In this example, the data input file is called TEST.DAT. The
definition file is TEST.DEF.  Three multiple attributes will be
defined for each map feature: a deer density attribute, a buck:doe ratio
attribute, and a fawn:doe ratio attribute.  Each attribute is a 3 character
long floating point number with 1 digit to the right of the decimal point.  At
this point the user may go directly to the ATTRIBUTE option (#3) or may
terminate the ATTDESCRIBE option.  In this example, the user wishes to add the
multiple attribute data (using a data input file and a definition file) to the
MOSS map, thus building the .AT file, as follows:


 PLEASE ENTER MAP NAME: TEST.MAP

 THE NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES IS     0
 THE NUMBER OF ITEMS IS          5

 PLEASE ENTER DESIRED OPTION 
  1  =  EXIT   [DEFAULT]
  2  =  ADD A NEW ATTRIBUTE
  3  =  UPDATE AN EXISTING ATTRIBUTE
  4  =  CHANGE/DELETE KEY OR DESCRIPTOR
  5  =  LIST ATTRIBUTE FIELDS
  6  =  SEARCH AN ATTRIBUTE FIELD
  7  =  RESEQUENCE AND ADD NEW ATT.
  8  =  RESEQUENCE INPUT FILE
  9  =  DELETE THE ATTRIBUTE FILE

 IS THIS A MULTI VARIABLE BATCH ADD (N): Y
 PLEASE ENTER THE NAME OF THE INPUT DATA FILE: TEST.DAT
 PLEASE ENTER THE NAME OF THE ATTRIBUTE DEFINITION FILE: TEST.DEF


 THE NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES IS     3
 THE NUMBER OF ITEMS IS          5

 PLEASE ENTER DESIRED OPTION 
  1  =  EXIT   [DEFAULT]
  2  =  ADD A NEW ATTRIBUTE
  3  =  UPDATE AN EXISTING ATTRIBUTE

  6  =  SEARCH AN ATTRIBUTE FIELD
  7  =  RESEQUENCE AND ADD NEW ATT.
  8  =  RESEQUENCE INPUT FILE
  9  =  DELETE THE ATTRIBUTE FILE

In this example, the user has built the .AT file for the map TEST.MAP, and now
wishes to search the database as follows:

: 5

  7  =  RESEQUENCE AND ADD NEW ATT.
  8  =  RESEQUENCE INPUT FILE
  9  =  DELETE THE ATTRIBUTE FILE

STOP

     In the above example, the user searched the multiple attribute file for
all items based on key name and then terminated the ATTRIBUTE option (#3).
