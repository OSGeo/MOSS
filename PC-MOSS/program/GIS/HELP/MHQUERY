QUERY                                                                     QUERY



     The QUERY command is summarized as follows:

          QUERY is a data description command which, for vector maps,
          identifies the map name, subject, and item of any feature being
          displayed on the graphics display terminal.  Items or features of
          interest are identified by the user via crosshair input.  If the
          item is a polygon or a line, QUERY also displays area and length,
          respectively.  If multiple active ID's with overlapping subjects
          are displayed simultaneously, the command will identify feature and
          subject from each individual map.  If the displayed map has a multi-
          ple attributes file, the command will identify each multiple attri-
          bute associated with the feature of interest.  QUERY can also process
          dichotomous, discrete, and continuous cell maps and displays northing
          and easting, row and column, cell value, and frequency and label for
          discrete cell maps.


     The QUERY command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          QUERY (crosshair input)*

          or

          QUERY ATTRIBUTE (crosshair input)*


     The individual parameters of the QUERY command are described below:

          (crosshair input) is where the user points with the cursor to the
          feature for which information is desired.  Once the crosshairs are
          positioned, the user "points" by hitting the SPACE key or the
          RETURN key.  Any other key will terminate the command.

          ATTRIBUTE is an option for the user to display information about the
          multiple attributes of a feature if the map has a multiple attributes
          file.  This parameter must be entered in an unprompted mode.


     The following is an example of use of the QUERY command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? QUERY
           POINT TO FEATURE, SPACE or RETURN will REPEAT.

            ITEM HAS FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS

           SUBJECT   = MULE DEER WINT CONC/WINT RANGE
           MAP NAME  = MDRWOLFRG ITEM NUMBER =     3
           AREA      =      3008.53 ACRES


     The limitations of the QUERY command are as follows:

          -- QUERY can only be used to identify features from the last map ID
             that was plotted or shaded.  Some commands issued between PLOT
             or SHADE and the QUERY command may cause the system to respond:
             NO ITEM FOUND.  TRY AGAIN.  In this case, the user should replot
             the map of interest and then re-issue the QUERY command.

          -- Use of any key except SPACE or RETURN will cause the command
             to terminate.

          -- If the space bar or the return key is entered more than once
             ('bounced'), the command may hang up and/or give erroneous
             results. To exit, enter the 'T' key twice. If 'ENTER COMMAND'
             prompt does not appear, enter the 'T' key twice more. Repeat
             this procedure until the prompt does appear.
