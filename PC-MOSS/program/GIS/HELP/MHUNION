UNION                                                                UNION



     The UNION command is summarized as follows:  

          The UNION command is used to convert overlapping polygons developed
          by the BUFFER command to single polygons, and/or to join polygons via a union process. 

          The UNION command is not limited to joining polygons with the same subject.  Instead ALL overlapping polygons, regardless of subject, are joined.

     The UNION command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

     UNION (active ID) (new map name)


     The individual parameters of the UNION command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a polygon map 
          referenced in the active map table that contains polygons to be joined.

          (new map name) is the name for the map resulting from UNION.


     The following is an example of use of the UNION command:

          ENTER COMMAND
          ? UNION
           PLEASE ENTER ACTIVE MAP TO UNION
         ? 1
           WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CALL THE NEW MAP (CR=QUIT)
           ----------
          ? MDMBU1

           --Working
           Number of Polygons to Union=         3
           Number of polygons created =         1
          BUILD MOSS MAP       DATA TYPE =   3

          ENTER COMMAND

     The limitations of the UNION command are as follows:

          -- Input map must be a polygon map.
 
          -- The window must be set prior to UNION.
