          STATUS is a program control command that computes and prints out
          information on: a) numbers of maps in master and work files, b) data
          type, storage location (disk vs. tape), and numbers of items and
          coordinate pairs for a vector map, or c) number of active maps,
          display device, master mapfile name, display window for the current
          session, and characteristics of the of the color device if one is
          present.  This information provides an index to volume and type
          of data associated with a particular mapfile, map, or session.

               7 MAPS IN WORK PROJECT   POLYGON


     The limitations of the STATUS command are as follows:
