IMPORT                                                           IMPORT



    The IMPORT command is summarized as follows:

         IMPORT is a data manipulation command that enters
         import/export format maps into a master database.  If multiple
         attributes data are to be imported, a system manager should be
         consulted.

     The IMPORT command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          IMPORT (input file) (new map name)* (template name)* (header)*
          (data type)*


     The individual parameters of the IMPORT command are described
     below:

          (input file) is the name of the import/export format map which
          is to be entered into the database. This file contains two
          types of records: header records and coordinate records.
          Each item has one header record which is formatted as follows:
 
          Item number     subject           Number of x,y pairs
          (I5,      10X,  30A1,    5X,      I5)

          The number of coordinate records matches the number of pairs
          in the header record.  Coordinate pairs for any X,Y system
          other than longitude/latitude use the format (F11.2,F11.2).
          A negative X coordinate in a polygon map indicates the start
          of an island.

          IMPORT file format is slightly different when coordinates are
          longitute/latitude.  Item numbers in the header records must
          be negative.  Coordinate pairs have the format (F10.5,F10.5,
          I2), the third value (I2) being an island flag with zero
          indicating no islands.  West longitude (e.g., in the USA)
          must be negative.

          To create examples of IMPORT/EXPORT files, use the EXPORT
          command.

          (new map name) is the name for the map which is to be imported
          to the data base.  If the map is to be created in the master
          data base, the full pathname must be entered along with the
          filename. If the master file is open when the IMPORT is
          executed and the pathname is not specified, the filename will
          be added to the .DT file but the file will reside in the
          user's directory.  The file can be added to the user's work
          files by opening POLYGON before performing the IMPORT.

          (template name) is the name of the map to use as a template
          for the header of the new map.  Edit the mapheader by
          responding to the (header) prompts described below.  If the
          user wants to start a new header from scratch, enter a
          carriage return and the new map header will be initialized
          to blanks.

          (header) are the prompts for the new map header.  If using
          a template, a carriage return will use the information
          shown in each prompt.  If no template is used, new
          information is entered for each prompt.  EXCEPT for the
          number of map subjects and scale factor, information entered
          into the header is literal data, i.e., their values have no
          effect on the handling of data.  The editing feature is
          important in changing the number of map subjects or the
          scale factor.

          If projection data is being entered, remember that all
          longitude values for the USA must be negative.


          (Scale factor) A factor of 0.1 is appropriate for map scales
          from 1:2000 through 1:12000; 1.0 (default) is appropriate for
          map scales from 1:12000 through 1:24000; 10.0 for map scales
          from 1:24000 through 1:100000; and 100.0 for a 1:125,000 map.
          For latitude/longitude data, experience indicates using a
          very small scale factor, e.g., .00001.  In general, the scale
          factor is computed as follows:  List the map and header
          (LIST mapname HE).  Subtract East from West and South from
          North for the Map Bounding Rectangle (MBR).  Divide the
          larger of the two by 32,000, rounding off to the nearest
          tenth.  This will be the scale factor.  The scale factor
          specifies the precision of data. A wrong scale factor will
          create a map with the correct MBR, but lines and polygons
          will be the wrong size.


          (Number of subjects) Enter the correct number.  If the map
          has more subjects than entered, the command will not
          terminate sucessfully. If a number greater than the correct
          number is entered, a file will be generated to accomodate
          that many subjects and tie up excessive disk space.  A value
          of -1 will create a new map with all items having one subject
          called "SUBJECTS" and a data file called mapname.OUT that
          contains subjects for each item.  This file can be used to
          resequence an input data file by matching the item order of
          the IMPORTed map (see UTILITY program ATTRIBUTE).

          (data type) is the type of data contained in the map, either
          point, line, polygon, elevation, or 3D (x,y,z). Be sure to
          enter the correct data type. Entering the wrong type may cause
          a file to be generated which cannot be used.

     The limitations of the IMPORT command are as follows:

          -- Cell data cannot be added.

          -- Maps with more than 2750 unique subjects cannot be added.

          -- No more than 32,000 maps can be in the master database.

          -- No more than 1280 islands are allowed per polygon.

          -- Input file must be in MOSS import/export format.

          -- Subjects in the new map will not be in alphabetical order.

          -- Must enter the correct number of map subjects.

          -- Must enter the correct data type.
