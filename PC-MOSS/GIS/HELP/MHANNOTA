ANNOTATE                                                               ANNOTATE



     The ANNOTATE command is summarized as follows:

	ANNOTATE is a data display command which is used to build a file
	which contains text that can be printed on a GCALCOMP plot.
        When the GCALCOMP command is executed, the user will be prompted
        for the name of the ANNOTATE file which should be included on
        the plot. This is the only command available for positioning
        text on a GCALCOMP plot.

        When constructing an ANNOTATE file, the map should be displayed
        using the PLOT command. Existing ANNOTATE files can be updated
        and displayed by entering the existing ANNOTATE file name. Text
        is positioned by crosshair input and the coordinates are stored
        in the output file as UTM data. The files are stored in the user's
        directory and may be deleted using the AOS DELETE command. The
        file names are not placed in any of the .DT files. The file may
        be edited by most system editors to correct misspellings, change
        FONT #, HEIGHT, WIDTH, ANGLE and PEN COLOR, and to adjust text
        location. The file is in ASCII format and may be listed using
        the AOS TYPE command.


     The ANNOTATE command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)


        ANNOTATE (output file name)* (font #)* (pen color)* (text height)*
        (text width)* (angle of text)* (text string)* (crosshair input)*


     The individual parameters of the ANNOTATE command are described below:

        (output file name) is the name of a disk file in which the text
        and associated parameters are being stored.  This file may be
        edited using the available system editor.

        (font #) is used to indicate the style in which the text is to
        be plotted. See the enclosed table for definitions of the font
        numbers.

        (pen color) is used to indicate which pen position number plots
        the text. The default color positions are 1-Black, 2-Red, 3-Blue
        and 4-Green.

        (height) and (width) are used to specify the height and width (in
        inches) of the plotted characters. (i.e. .07, .1, 1.)

        (angle) is the rotation of the text on the plot and is measured
        from the horizontal. A 90 degree angle whould plot text which
        is read from the bottom to the top. 270 degrees would read from
        top to bottom. 180 degrees produces text which appears to be
        upside down.

        (text string) is the actual text to be displayed on the plot.
        The maximum string length is 60 characters.

        (crosshair input) is used to indicate the starting location of
        the lower left corner of the line of text. Move the crosshairs
        to the place where the text should begin and <return>. Better
        control can be exercised on terminals where the cursors are
        moved by keys rather than thumbwheels. The user can count key-
        strokes and line up successive lines of text more accurately.


     The following is an example of the use of the ANNOTATE command:

         Enter command
        ? ANNOTATE
         ENTER the name of
         the ANNOTATE file:
        --------------------
        ANNOTEST

         Creating the
         ANNOTATE file named:
        --------------------
          ANNOTEST

         Enter the following:
         IFONT, IPEN, H, W, ANG

         TEXT [CR=done]

        ------------------------


         Do you want to add more              (Note: By answering yes to this
         TEXT to the file named:               prompt, the font #, pen color,
         -------------------                   height, width, and angle
          ANNOTEST                             may be changed.)

     The limitations to the ANNOTATE command are as follows:

          -- Window must be set.

          -- The ANNOTATE file can not be used with the CALCOMP, HEWLETT,
             ZETA AND VERSATEC commands or with COS.

          -- Moving text locations on a map is a skill developed with
             experience. UTM coordinates are in meters. Therefore, on
             a map having a scale of 1:1,000,000, adding 1000 to the x-
             coordinate will move the text 1 cm to the right. -1000
             would move it 1 cm to the left. Adding 1000 to the y-coor-
             dinate moves it up 1 cm and subtracting 1000 moves it down
             1 cm.

                   SCALE         EFFECT OF 1000
                                 METER CHANGE

                   1:24,000      41.67 cm

          -- ANNOTATE file can not be selected. To view the file contents,
             execute the ANNOTATE command and specify the name of the

          -- Size of the text on the screen is not an accurate representation
             of the true size of the text relative to the map scale. The
             map must be plotted on a ZETA plotter to view the true
             results.
