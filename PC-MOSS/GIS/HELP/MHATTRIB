3 - ATTRIBUTE  (MOSS MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE SUPPORT)

     This option provides a means of creating, searching, modifying, and
updating the multiple attribute file (.AT file) of a MOSS map.  The following
is an example of use of ATTRIBUTE:


 PLEASE ENTER MAP NAME: TEST.MAP

 THE NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES IS     3
 THE NUMBER OF ITEMS IS          5

 PLEASE ENTER DESIRED OPTION
  1  =  EXIT   [DEFAULT]
  2  =  ADD A NEW ATTRIBUTE
  3  =  UPDATE AN EXISTING ATTRIBUTE
  4  =  CHANGE/DELETE KEY OR DESCRIPTOR
  5  =  LIST ATTRIBUTE FIELDS
  6  =  SEARCH AN ATTRIBUTE FIELD
  7  =  RESEQUENCE AND ADD NEW ATT.
  8  =  RESEQUENCE INPUT FILE
  9  =  DELETE THE ATTRIBUTE FILE
:5

     In this example, the user desires information on the multiple attribute
file of a map called TEST.MAP.  This map contains five items with three
attributes per item.  The user may:

 1-terminate the ATTRIBUTE program (this is the default).
 2-add new multiple attributes interactively, or using files,
 4-modify all values for an existing attribute,
 4-change or delete keys and headers,
 5-list the attribute dictionary and search by key ID number or key name,
 6-search the attribute by key ID number or key name,
 7-resequence an input data file and add attributes using an existing definition file.
 8-resequence an input data file only if map subjects were integer numbers.
 9-delete the attribute (.AT) file,

Examples of use of options 2 and 5 are shown under the ATTDESCRIBE option (#4).
