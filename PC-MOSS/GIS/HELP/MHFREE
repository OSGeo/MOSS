     The FREE command is summarized as follows:

          FREE is a data manipulation command that deactivates any ID referenced
          in the active map table.


     The FREE command is specified as follows:

          FREE (active ID's)


     The individual parameters of the FREE command are described below:

          (active ID'S) are the ID numbers of the maps to be deactivated, i.e.,
          deleted from the active map table.  If the entire active map table is
          to be deactivated, the user may enter ALL instead of the active ID
          numbers.  Active ID's can be entered in any order and the remaining
          active maps will be renumbered accordingly.


     The following is an example of use of the FREE command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? FREE
           ENTER ALL OR ACTIVE MAP ID'S
          ? 4 2


     The limitations of the FREE command are as follows:

          -- Cannot free inclusive strings of ID's, for example "2 6" will
             only free ID 2 and ID 6, not ID 2 through ID 6.
