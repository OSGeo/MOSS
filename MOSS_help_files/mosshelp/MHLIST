LIST                                                                       LIST



     The LIST command is summarized as follows:

          LIST is a data manipulation command that allows the user to browse
          the list of map names in the database and if working with color,
          list the contents of the pseudo device table and/or the contents
          of the color lookup definition table.


     The LIST command is specified as follows:

          LIST (option) (template)


     The individual parameters of the LIST command are described below:

          (option) is the source of the data the user wishes information about.
          The user must respond with MAPS, MASTER, WORK, DEVICES ,COLORS, or
          a map name.  The MAP option will produce an alphabetized listing
          of all maps in both the master and workfile.  The MASTER option will
          list only the map names in the master database while the WORK option
          will list only the map names in the work database.  The DEVICES
          option will list all available color raster devices along with
          their characteristics.  The COLORS option will list all color
          lookup definition names on the color LUT database or will list
          all the colors and their intensities for a given color LUT
          definition.  If the user responds with a map name the DESCRIBE
          command is executed to retain compatiblity with previous revisions.

          (template) is an opportunity for the user to inquire more specif-
          ically about the list of map names.  If the user responds MAPS,
          MASTER, or WORK to the (option) prompt, this parameter must be
          entered on the same line, i.e., can only be entered in an un-prompted
          mode.  (template) allows the user to list only those maps whose
          names contain a specific string of characters.  Allowed (templates)
          are +STRING, STRING+, +STRING+, or STRING+STRING where STRING is
          a ten character or less search string and the + must be entered.


     The following is an example of use of the LIST command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? LIST
           ENTER: MAPS, MASTER, WORK, DEVICES, COLORS, OR <MAPNAME>
          ? MASTER M+


     The limitations of the LIST command are as follows:

          -- None found to date.
