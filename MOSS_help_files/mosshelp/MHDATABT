2 - DATABTEST  (MOSS PROJECT.DT FILE MAINTENANCE)

     This program allows the user to look at, modify, or update a map names file
(.DT file, also see OPEN command).  This file may be a master project
(project.DT) file or a work project (POLYGON.DT) map names file.  In order to
access a master project.DT file, the user must have write access and execute
DATABTEST from within the directory containing the project.DT file.  The program
is used, for example, to add a map from another installation to a master
project.DT file. The map names file (project.DT) is only a convinence for the
user, since existing maps in a project can be accessed even if not in the
project.DT file.

      The following is an example of use of DATABTEST:

     In this example, the user examines the map names list for his/her work
project (POLYGON).  There are five maps in the project.  The LIST option
provides information about each map.  The delete option is used to re-
move a map name (TEST) from the project and then the add option is used to re-
place it.  The user may also search a project by map name (find option) or
terminate DATABTEST (finish option).  The rename option is not currently opera-
tional.  Note that the delete option does not delete the map from disk, only
the map name from the project.DT file.

     If several maps are on disk but no project.DT file exists the DATABTEST
ADD option can be used with a prepared input file.  Use the operating system
to build the list of map names (for AOS use F/S/CPL=30/L=MAP.LIST), insert the
name of the project at the beginning of the list, insert a 2 in front of the
map names, and insert a 1 (for finish) at the end of the list.  For cell maps,
make a list of all +.HD files then remove the .HD with an editor.  The prepared
input file (called MAP.LIST in this example) would look like:

POLYGON
2 MAPONE
2 MAPTWO
2 MAPTHREE
1

After the input file is built use, the MOSS.BATCH macro to build the project.DT
file.
