TESTGRID                                                   TESTGRID



     The TESTGRID command is summarized as follows:

         TESTGRID is a data display command which superimposes a
         cell grid over any map displayed on the graphic display
         terminal.  When used wtih the RASTERIZE or POLYCELL
         commands, it helps determine appropriate cell size for
         converting a polygon map to a cell map.  When used with the
         GRID command, it helps determine appropriate cell size for
         gridding the point data.  Cell size can be specified in
         acres and height-to-width ratio, or in meters in width and
         height.


     The TESTGRID command is specified as follows:

          TESTGRID ([A]cres or [M]eters) (cell width) (cell height)
                   (cell ratio) (cell size) (export)

     The individual parameters of the TESTGRID command are described
     below:

          ([A]cres or [M]eters) are units on a cell side.  If [M]eters
          are chosen, the user is then asked for cell width and cell
          height in meters.  If [A]cres are chosen, the user is asked
          for the cell ratio (Y/X) and cell size in acres.

          (cell width) is the width of the cell in meters.

          (cell height) is the height of the cell in meters.

          (cell ratio) is the ratio of the number of meters in Y to the
          number of meters in X on an individual cell.

          (cell size) is the cell size in acres.

          (export) is an option for the user to save the grid in export
          format in a file called "EXPORT" .


     The following are examples of use of the TESTGRID command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? TESTGRID
           ENTER [A]cres or [M]eters on a side ? M
           Please enter cell width in meters ? 1000
           Please enter cell height in meters ? 1000
           SAVE THE GRID AS A MOSS EXPORT FILE (Y/N) [CR = N]? <CR>


           ENTER COMMAND
          ? TESTGRID
           ENTER [A]cres or [M]eters on a side ? A
           ENTER CELL SIZE RATIO (Y/X I.E. 1.25;  CR = 1.) ? 1
           ENTER CELL SIZE IN ACRES ? 1
           SAVE THE GRID AS A MOSS EXPORT FILE (Y/N) [CR = N]? Y


     The limitations of the TESTGRID command are as follows:

          -- Window must be set.

          -- If the (export) option is used, any existing "Export" file
             is deleted.

          -- If a testgrid saved as an "Export" file is to be used as
             a new map in subsequent MOSS analyses, it must be added
             to the data base with the command IMPORT as a line (type 2)
             map.  See IMPORT for further information.

          -- TESTGRID may change the window size slightly (either
             larger or smaller) for the display in order to show
             complete cells.  It resets the window when the display is
             complete.  This means the location of the grid on the
             screen will not exactly coincide with maps plotted before
             or after TESTGRID is used.
