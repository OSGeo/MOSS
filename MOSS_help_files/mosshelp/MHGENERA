GENERATE                                                               GENERATE



     The GENERATE command is summarized as follows:

          GENERATE is a data manipulation command that allows the user to create
          new MOSS maps interactively at a graphics terminal.  Point, line,
          polygon, circle, and rectangular features may be created using the
          graphics cursor.  In addition, point, line, and polygon features may
          be created by entering actual (x,y) coordinate data via the keyboard.
          The user is given the option of using another map's header as a
          template for generating a header for the new map. This feature also
          carries the projection with it.

          GENERATE is best used in two terminal mode due to the amount of user
          interaction requiring textual input and graphics output.

     The GENERATE command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          GENERATE (new map name)* (template option)* (new map description)*
          (map data type)* (input mode)* (feature subject)*


     The individual parameters of the GENERATE command are described below:

          (new map name) is the name for the map to be created using GENERATE.

          (template option) is a means for the user to copy header and pro-
          jection information from an existing file to the new file. If Yes
          is given in response to the prompt, the user is queried for a file 
          name.

          (new map description) is a description of the map to be created.
          This information will be stored in the map header.

          (map data type) is the type of feature to be created.  The user may
          enter POINT, LINE, POLYGON.  Only the first character is required.
          If the map data type selected is polygon, the user is prompted to
          select one of the following feature types, POLYGON, CIRCLE, or
          RECTANGLE, or given the option, QUIT to exit. If the data type is
          point or line, the user may QUIT to exit. A <return> will cause the
          next prompt for point or line data to be displayed.

          (input mode) is an option for the user to specify how the new data
          will be entered.  If the user enters [C]ursor, input will be via the
          CRT graphics cursor.  If the user enters [KEY]board, input will be
          via typed-in (x,y) coordinate pairs.  In cursor mode, the command
          operates within the current window setting.  Note that polygon
          coordinates must be entered in clockwise order and need not be
          closed.

          (feature subject) is the subject to be assigned to the new feature.


     The following is an example of use of the GENERATE command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? GENERATE
           WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CALL THE NEW MAP
            __________
          ? MDMIGRAT
           USE ANOTHER MAP'S HEADER AS A TEMPLATE [Y]?
           ENTER MAPNAME FOR HEADER TEMPLATE:  ? MDRWOLFRG
          MULE DEER RANGE      WOLF RIDGE         COLORADO  1:24000
          ------------------------------------------------------------
           ENTER NEW DESCRIPTION OR RETURN TO RETAIN TEMPLATES DESCRIPTION
          REVISED MULE DEER MIGRATION ROUTES
           ENTER DATA TYPE THIS MAP IS TO BE:
                1 - POINT
                2 - LINE
                3 - POLYGON
                  ? 2
           KEYBOARD OR CURSOR INPUT (K/C) ? C
           QUIT (Q) TO EXIT:  ?            (enter <RETURN> to continue)
           ENTER SUBJECT FOR THIS FEATURE
          ? MIGRATION ROUTE 1
           ENTER POINTS FOR FEATURE. TERMINATE WITH T KEY
           QUIT (Q) TO EXIT:  ? Q


     The limitations of the GENERATE command are as follows:

          -- No more than 100 new features per GENERATE process.

          -- Cannot create islands within polygons.

          -- Window must be set for cursor input mode.

          -- No more than 100 subjects in the new map.

          -- Polygons must be entered with the coordinates in clockwise
             order.

          -- Subjects in the new map will not be in alphabetical order.

          -- Unless the template option is selected, no projection type is
             assigned to the new map.

          -- Can only enter POINT, LINE, or POLYGON with keyboard input.
