CONTOUR                                                               CONTOUR



     The CONTOUR command is summarized as follows:

          CONTOUR is a data display command which generates a contour map from
          a continuous cell map.  The result may be saved as a line map in
          the workfile and/or displayed on the CRT.  Note that as the number
          of cells per map increases, processing time increases.


     The CONTOUR command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          CONTOUR (active ID) (contour specification) (display) (save)
          (new map name) (minimum contour) (contour interval) (contour values)*


     The individual parameters of the CONTOUR command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a continuous cell map (type 8)
          referenced in the active map table.

          (contour specification) is an option to calulate equally spaced
          contours or specify each individual countour's value.  The user must
          enter [U]ser defined to specify each contour's value or [C]alculated
          for contours to be calcuated automatically.

          (minimum contour) is the starting  contour value.  The default is
          the minimum value in the cell map.  This may be negitive. This
          parameter applies only if the CALCULATE contour option was selected.

          (contour interval) is the increment between contours. This must
          positive and greater than or equal to one. This parameter only
          applies if the users has selected the CALCULATE contours option.

          (display) is an option for the user to display the contours on the
          CRT.  The user must respond YES or NO (Y/N).  If this option is
          selected, the contour lines will be labeled.

          (save) is an option for the user to save the resultant line map in
          the user's work area.  The user must enter YES or NO (Y/N).

          (new map name) is the name for the line map resulting from CONTOUR.
          This parameter applies only if the new map is to be saved in the
          user's work area.

          (contour values) is where the user specifies the values each contour
          if the USER DEFINED contours option has been selected.


     The following is an example of use of the CONTOUR command:

           ENTER COMMAND
          ? CONTOUR
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP ID TO CONTOUR
          ? 1
           User defined or Calculated  intervals (U/C)   C
           Do you want contours displayed ? (Y/N) [N]    Y
           Save the result of this task ? (Y/N)  [N]   Y
           What do you wish to call the new map ?
            __________
            CONTOURMAP
           Minimum contour value desired (   -53 to     286) [   -53]  -50
           Contour increment value desired  50
                           7 INTERVALS BEING USED ARE

           -50    0     50     100   150    200    250


     The limitations of the CONTOUR command are as follows:

          -- Only active continuous cell maps may be used.

          -- A maximum of 128 contour values may be specified.

          -- The labeling algorithm may write labels over labels.

          -- Contour interval must be an integer value.
