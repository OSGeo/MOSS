UTILITY                                                                 UTILITY



     The UTILITY command is summarized as follows:

          UTILITY is a program control command which allows the user to access
          several ancillary utility programs. Although these programs are not
          germaine to the operation of MOSS or MAPS, they facilitate database
          construction and maintenance and will be of special interest to sys-
          tem managers and advanced users.  The utility programs are presented
          as a menu of choices. Details for each programs are available by
          using the HELP command with the program name.


     There are no individual parameters associated with the UTILITY command.



     The UTILITY command is specified as follows:

           ENTER COMMAND: UTILITY

ENTER MOSS UTILITY OPTION


 ENTER MOSS UTILITY OPTION 
   1  =  TERMINATE UTILITY SESSION   [DEFAULT]
   2  =  DATABTEST   (MOSS MAP NAMES SUPPORT)
   3  =  ATTRIBUTE   (MOSS MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE SUPPORT)
   4  =  ATTDESCRIBE (BUILD MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE BATCH INPUT FILE)
   5  =  SUB2AT      (SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE INPUT)
   6  =  APROJ       (MOSS MAP NAMES PROJECTION ASSIGNMENT)
   7  =  BROWZ       (MOSS MAP NAMES HEADER LISTING)
   8  =  PLOT.LEGEND (BUILD CALCOMP LEGEND FILE)
   9  =  MAKE.LOGO   (BUILD CALCOMP LOGO FILE)
  10  =  MODEL.EDIT  (CREATE AND MODIFY RASTER MODEL DEFINITION)
  11  =  SUBEDIT     (MAP SUBJECT EDIT PROGRAM)
  12  =  SET.LEVEL   (BUILD POLYCELL TRANSLATION FILE)
  13  =  TRANSFORM   (TRANSFORM COORDINATES TO A PROJECTION)
  14  =  QUAD        (MAKE A QUAD MAP IN IMPORT/EXPORT FORMAT)
  15  =  DLG5        (USGS DLG ASCII TO MOSS)
  16  =  MAPIDX      (MAKE INDEX MAP OF PROJECT IN IMPORT/EXPORT FORMAT)
: 1

  MOSS UTILITY SESSION COMPLETED

          Most of the UTILITY options can be run in batch mode by using the
          program name as the third arguement in the command line. For example;

          )  QBATCH/I/NOTIFY
          )) MOSS.BATCH PROJECT PROGRAM.NAME
          )) INPUT.FILE
          )))

          Since MAKE.LOGO requires interactive cursor input, it cannot be run
          in batch.TERMINATE is not a program so can not be run in batch.

          You can  also access the utility programs outside of MOSS by
          initiating the MOSS.UTIL macro from within any directory by
          specifying the complete directory pathname of the macro.

          For example:

          ):IS:MOSS:MOSS.UTIL

     The limitations of the UTILITY command are as follows:

          -- None found to date.
