REPORT                                                                   REPORT



     The REPORT command is summarized as follows: 

          REPORT is a data description command that generates tabular reports
          of the multiple attributes database.  The tabular report is written
          to the screen or to a disk file.

     The REPORT command is specified as follows:
     (* denotes parameters which can only be entered in a prompted mode)

          REPORT (active ID) (HARDCOPY) (no label)* (number of columns)*
          (area/length)* (subject)* (column designators)*


     The individual parameters of the REPORT command are described below:

          (active ID) is the ID number of a map referenced in the active map
          table for which information is desired.

          (HARDCOPY) is an option to obtain a hardcopy listing of the REPORT
          table on a line printer.  If HARDCOPY is specified, output is written
          to a disk file called LINE.PRINTER.  This file can be printed by
          exiting MOSS and issuing the operating system print command.  If
          anything other than the characters HARDCOPY are specified in this
          option, the characters are used to specify a file name and the output
          is written to the file.  If the file exists, the existing data in the
          file is overwritten by the report. The report can be directed to the
          screen by responding to the prompt with a return.

          (no label) is an option which produces a table without column headings.

          (number of columns) is the number of columns of attributes desired.
          If necessary, the report will be written in multiple sections. Each
          section will contain 6 columns if the output is directed to the
          screen. The hardcopy file will have 10 columns to a section. Each
          section is labeled but only the first section is titled.


          (area/length) is an opportunity to include polygon area information
          for a polygon map or line length information for a line maps. This
          information will appear in the last column of the last section of the
          table.


          (subjects) is an opportunity for subjects to be included as a
          column. If the answer is Yes, the subject appears as the first column
          in each section.

          (column designators) are the attributes for the map of interest
          which are to be in the columns of the report table.


     The following is an example of use of the REPORT command:

          ENTER COMMAND
          ? REPORT
           ENTER ACTIVE MAP I.D. TO REPORT ? 1
           ENTER "HARD" OR <FILENAME> FOR HARDCOPY OUTPUT
           <RETURN> FOR SCREEN OUTPUT ?
           DO YOU WANT UNLABELED OUTPUT [No] ?
           ENTER NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN TABLE ? 3
           DO YOU WISH POLYGON AREAS OUTPUT ? Y
           DO YOU WISH SUBJECTS OUTPUT ? Y
           FOR COLUMN 1
           RETRIEVE ATRIBUTE FIELD BY:  0 - QUIT  1 - ID  2 - KEY ? 1
           ENTER THE ATTRIBUTE ID ? 8
           FOR COLUMN 2
           RETRIEVE ATRIBUTE FIELD BY:  0 - QUIT  1 - ID  2 - KEY ? 2
           ENTER THE ATTRIBUTE KEY ? HOMERANGE
           FOR COLUMN 3
           RETRIEVE ATRIBUTE FIELD BY:  0 - QUIT  1 - ID  2 - KEY ? 1
           ENTER THE ATTRIBUTE ID ? 3


     The limitations of the REPORT command are as follows:

          -- Map must have a multiple attributes file.

          -- If the LINE.PRINTER file created by use of the command is to be
             saved, it should be renamed since existing LINE.PRINTER files are
             always overwritten by subsequent use.

          -- Truncates character data to the first 10 characters.
