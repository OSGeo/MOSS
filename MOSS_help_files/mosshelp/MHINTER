INTERLINE                                                             INTERLINE

     Interline is a line intersector command which will 'cut' the major map
     based upon intersections with the minor map.  The resultant map will be
     a series of line segments which will not cross any item in the minor
     map.

INTerline ID1 ID2 NEW_MAP_NAME (subject merge options)*

     ID1 is the major map to 'cut' into segments

     ID2 is the minor map to 'cut' ID1

     NEW_MAP_NAME is the resultant map's name

     (subject merge options)* are options required to merge subjects of the
         two active IDs or to build a new subject from one or both subjects
         from the two active IDs

Example:

INTerline 1 2 MAPOUT
Do you want to specify SUBJECT MERGE parameter [CR=NO]
   [NO = 14 chars from 1st and 16 chars from 2nd]
   [YES= input # chars from each subject]
   [REV= reverse order of subjects      ]        : NO

  INTERSECTED FEATURES =   128

Limitations:

     - Active IDs must exist

     - Only works with line data types

     - 256 intersections for each item in major ID
