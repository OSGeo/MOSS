# Contributing to the PC-MOSS Historical Archive

We welcome contributions from the community to help archive the MOSS utilties, 
source code and its documentation!  It is important that this important 
historical FOSS4G project live on.

# How You Can Help

As you may have noticed, the documentation and the files are very old, 
and there is much work to do to bring the documentation & all project files 
into a more easily shareable format.  Please help!  

# Communication and Sharing Ideas

Until we have a better way to communicate otherwise, please create a new 
[issue](https://github.com/ploewe/MOSS/issues) for it. This will allow 
the MOSS-archive team to discuss it.

You can also connect to the #moss channel through IRC on the *irc.libera.chat*
network.  Connect directly through your [browser](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#moss) 
or see other connection [options](https://libera.chat).
